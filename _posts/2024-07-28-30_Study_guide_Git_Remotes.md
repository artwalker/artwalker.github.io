| Command | Explanation |
| ---- | ---- |
| [git remote](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-remote) | allows you to manage the set of repositories or “remotes” whose branches you track. |
| [git remote -v](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-remote#Documentation/git-remote.txt--v) |  is similar to $ git remote, but adding the -v shows more information such as the remote URL. |
| [git remote show <name>](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-remote#Documentation/git-remote.txt-emshowem) | shows some information about a single remote repo. |
| [git remote update](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-remote#Documentation/git-remote.txt-emupdateem) | fetches updates for remotes or remote groups. |
| [git fetch](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-fetch) | can download objects and refs from a single repo, a single URL, or from several repositories at once. |
| [git branch -r](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-branch#Documentation/git-branch.txt--r) | lists remote branches and can be combined with other branch arguments to manage remote branches. |
