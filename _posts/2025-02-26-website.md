   2. **build-gh**: replace `github-username` with your GitHub username and `repo-name` with the repository name
2. Commit and push those changes to `package.json` to your GitHub remote repo.
3. Open a new terminal from the menu or by pressing `ctrl` + `shift` + ` (or open top left menu, select "Terminal" and "New Terminal")
4. Within the terminal window run `npm run deploy`. This will first run the pre-deploy script to build the project, followed by the deploy script that will push those bundled files to a new branch on your repo (gh-pages) that will be used for you GitHub Pages site.
5. When completed, within your repo, go to Settings and Pages. There you will see that a page has been set up to for you against the gh-pages branch, and you should see the URL (that should match the “homepage” value you set in package.json)
